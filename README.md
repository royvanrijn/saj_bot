# SAJ bot

*This is 100% generated by Codex, don't use as is, completely untested at the moment.*

This project provides a small Spring Boot application that aims to optimise the operation of the SAJ H2 Home Battery.  
Using weather forecasts and electricity prices the bot decides when the battery should charge or discharge.  
All collected sensor data and decisions are stored in a local H2 database so that the algorithm can be tuned in the future.

## Features
- REST API that exposes the current battery level, collected data and a summary endpoint.
- Reads hourly weather forecasts from **OpenWeatherMap** based on the location
  configured in `application.yml` and uses this data to predict solar output for
  the next hour.
- Reads electricity prices from a configurable endpoint.
- Simple "brain" that periodically evaluates the situation and charges/discharges the battery.
- Stores data points in an embedded H2 database.
- Built using Java 17, Maven and Spring Boot.

## Configuration

Set the following properties in `src/main/resources/application.yml` to
customise the bot:

- `weather.api-key` &ndash; OpenWeatherMap API key used to retrieve the hourly
  forecast.
- `weather.location` &ndash; Location string recognised by OpenWeatherMap.
- `electricity.price-url` &ndash; Endpoint that returns import and export
  prices.
- `saj.host` &ndash; Hostname or IP address of the SAJ inverter.
- `saj.port` &ndash; Modbus TCP port of the SAJ inverter.

## Maven proxy settings

Maven requires network access to download dependencies. The included
`settings.xml` configures a proxy so builds work behind a firewall. Use
the file with the `-s` flag whenever running Maven.

## Running locally

```
mvn -s settings.xml spring-boot:run
```

### Running tests

```
mvn -s settings.xml test
```

After startup the REST endpoints will be available on `http://localhost:8080/api`.

## Running on Umbrel
Umbrel allows running Docker based applications. Build the container and deploy it via the Umbrel interface:

```
mvn -s settings.xml -DskipTests package
docker build -t sajbot .
docker run -p 8080:8080 sajbot
```

You can then access the web UI at `http://umbrel.local:8080`.
